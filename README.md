# Tbadoul – Human–Computer Interaction Course Project (Front-End)

**Tbadoul** was developed as part of the **Human–Computer Interaction** (HCI) course in university. It's a pure **front-end project**, where our team of four students collaborated—each of us responsible for a separate page. I served as the **team leader**, organising our efforts and keeping the project on track.

- **Team roles**:
  - I acted as **leader**, coordinating development and team communication.
  - The **fourth member** handled the **graphics work and logos**.
  - The other **three of us** (including me) built the **web pages** themselves.
  
The site is built in **Arabic**, per the professor’s requirement. It showcases our ability to design and implement user-interfacing functionality while accommodating right-to-left language layouts.
